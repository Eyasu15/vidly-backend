# vidly-backend
This is the back end created for my vidly project at: https://github.com/Eyasu15/vidly.

The project allows clients to complete any CRUD operations for Users, Customers, Movies, and Rental through RESTful endpoints.

## To use this project:
 1. Clone
 (Skip steps 2 and 3 if you want to modify the datasource in the application.properties.)
 2. Create a MySQL database with name vidly.
 3. Grant all access to the vidly database to 'vidly'@'localhost' identified by 'password'.
 4. Open the project in your favorite IDE for java and run.
(For best results also clone the front-end part of this project, which is made with React.js)
